I"™4<p>Functional CSS (or Atomic CSS, Utility-first CSS, and so forth) is a thing and it looks like it‚Äôs here to stay. My first trials with this technology were quite lazy attempts to make my styling more organized and utilitarian. There‚Äôs something that always bothered me with the regular approach to CSS classes and their taxonomy: <strong>elements accumulate and transform their meanings over time</strong>. In my opinion, no matter how tidy and organized your styling is, even BEM will let you down when you need last minute tweaks or a super urgent new feature.</p>

That‚Äôs why CSS classes based on semantics become a problem in the long run.</h3>

<p>As designers and developers, it‚Äôs very unlikely that we‚Äôll have enough time to plan to predict all of the visual categories and semantic elements their project will require from ground zero to launch. We can use wireframes and high fidelity mockups to guide our ways through development, however these assets can be quite time consuming to change or rebuild when you have a day or so to implement a new section or feature on a website.</p>

<p>Hannah works for a big company in the media business. She‚Äôs responsible for updating and maintaining their front end based on requests created by different departments. The projects she works on vary from very small to huge scales, and she very often touches designs developed by different co-workers and third-party providers.</p>

<p>On a specific project, she needed to update the following hero:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post/I-believe-you-should-try-functional-css-mockup.jpg" alt="hero to be updated by Hannah" title="hero to be updated by Hannah" /></p>

<p>And here are the markup and stylesheet being used on the page:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"hero container"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good practices aside, Hannah cringed a little to see that the naming convention did not make sense to her. What does the class <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.larger</code></em> even mean? Why is there a <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code></em> element with inline styling inside a paragraph? Is there a specific reason to force a line break instead of a block element? And this is just the tip of the iceberg in a set of 4 long pages she had to update.</p>

<p>What if she tried a different, <strong>BEM</strong> based approach? Let‚Äôs see how that would go:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.hero-card</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="sx">url('img/hero.jpg')</span> <span class="nb">bottom</span> <span class="nb">center</span> <span class="n">cover</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="nl">text-align</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">center</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#ffffff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.hero-card__content</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">padding</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">2rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.hero-card__title</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1.8rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.hero-card__date</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1.2rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.hero-card__body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0.85rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.hero-card__logo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">20%</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="nl">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">20%</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="nl">object-fit</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">cover</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hannah believes this approach makes her styling and markup way more readable and easier to update. If the client wants to add more information in the future, she can reuse any of the classes she created here or simply add a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.hero-card__element--modifier</code> class and keep the car running. This is important to her company and the fast turnaround she has for most projects. Spending less time understanding what things <strong>mean</strong> and more time fine-tuning what they <strong>do</strong> is fundamental here.</p>

<p>With her code based refactored for all the pages, Hannah presented the result the next day (did I mention the turnaround is <em>very, very fast</em>?) and waited for client approval to deploy the new version. Everything should be live the next day so the attendees could shop for tickets and accommodation.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when the clients decided they wanted not only one, but several changes in the way the pages were working. On the hero, they wanted to include a brief description below the callout, add in a legal type, and introduce a second sponsor logo along with the existing one.</p>

<p>Some of those changes were pretty straightforward, but others start to complicate the readability of Hanna‚Äôs styling ‚Äî especially the ones that depend on <strong>meaning</strong>. For text classes, she already had <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code>. Would she add two extra classes named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">description</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legal</code> respectively? What‚Äôs the hierarchy rule for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">description</code> anyway? The meaning of these categories starts to blend and become a blurry, arbitrary set of assumptions hard to read in the future. This happens very often on last-minute changes, and achieving the desired result can compromise the logic of the naming conventions very easily.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see how these text classes can be optimized using <strong>Functional CSS</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.has-text-xl</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">2rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.has-text-lg</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1.5rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.has-text-md</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.has-text-sm</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0.85rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.has-text-xs</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0.7rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same logic can be used for padding, margin, and other styling elements that need fine grain control. Hannah now has 5 classes for type size that can be used throughout the whole project, with a <strong>mixed</strong> BEM-functional approach.</p>

<p>I first started to explore a functional approach to CSS with the amazing <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> framework. It saved me <strong>tons</strong> of hours and headaches for a large scale, last minute website I was working on. There was obviously a learning curve and a feeling of <em>‚Äúwhy am I writing so much CSS?‚Äù</em> in the beginning, but I quickly found out that detaching my styling from meaning and trusting it to be handled by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">semantic HTML5</a> was a pretty good choice for most projects.</p>

<p>As it often happens to web development, each use case might bring a new set of needs and a different approach on how to solve a problem, but my experience with Functional CSS has been very rewarding so far and I believe it‚Äôs a very good practice to keep in mind.</p>
