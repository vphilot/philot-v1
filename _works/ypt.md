### YPT was receiving many complaints and a load of phonecalls from people who could not understand their mobile ticketing system. The experience was confusing, annoying, and frustrating. No one likes frustrated users.

Young People's Theatre gives the opportunity to many actors, children, and schools to experience plays that explore educational and ethical values. What they were lacking was some treatment on their website an their mobile ticketing experience. As part of the Advanced UX course on the INM program, this project was developed with a clinical eye for user satisfaction. I started off by making a couple of interviews and user testing with people who usually buy the tickets for their children: parents.

They liked the website at a first glance, but after a few minutes, they became so frustrated to the point of simply giving up. The outcomes of this process were fundamental to build a comprehensive set of constraints and guidelines for the upcoming UI overhaul.

My goal with this process was to provide consistency and continuity to users. They should be able to know where they're at, where they came from, and where they'll go to next. There are hooks implemented in the interface to depict this connection between one page and the other (I did not opt for breadcrumbs though as I don't think they look elegant on a mobile display). By doing so, at least half of the frustration would be ditched away and the rest could be dealt with information accessibility and whitespace.

Providing feedback on every single step was also fundamental. Users should know whether an action is accomplished, pending, or canceled. I created a set of components using this blobby shape to try and create visual interest in the pages while maintaining the key sections as simple and clean as possible
