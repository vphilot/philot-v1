profile: Thank you for stopping by! You can call me <strong>Vini</strong> and I like building web apps. I believe everything we do together should be accessible and inclusive.
motto: ! all work, no BS &mdash; we're kind &mdash; we're helpful &mdash; we respect each other's time &mdash; we build something to be proud of &mdash; <a href="https://www.ruinedby.design/" target="blank">Ruined by Design</a>
bg: I started building simple websites for friends and family using Flash when I was 17 years old, using a very rudimentary implementation of ActionScript2 I had learned by myself. I didn't think I could make a living out of it for a while, so I experimented with different career perspectives until I finally decided to take a chance and do what I love full time.
stack:
  - Typescript (vanilla)
  - Vue
  - React
  - Tailwind
  - Material
  - Jest
  - HTML5
  - Sass
  - Figma
apps:
  - I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> for dev-related tasks. I've used Atom before, tried WebStorm, but I think VSCode is just way faster and easier to customize.
  - My preferred theme is <a href="https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/" target="_blank">Dracula</a> with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/" target="_blank">JetBrains Mono</a>.
  - iTerm2 with zsh + <a hreg="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k" target="_blank">powerlevel10k</a>. Love <a href="https://gist.github.com/irazasyed/5987629" target="_blank">using aliases</a> too.
  - I have no preferred browser but I like (unpopular opinion alert) Safari for everyday use and Chrome for development.
  - I use a Macbook Pro 15 (2019) and my favourite MacOS productiviy tools are <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12" target="_blank">Copyclip</a> and <a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/" target="_blank">Magnet</a>.
facts:
  - ! Brazilian Canadian, born in a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LevuqobMVP5SAVeP8" target="blank">tiny little town</a> amid the Atlantic Rainforest, grandson of farmers, and proud of every single tiny victory I've accomplished.
  - I was a certified Architect before moving to Web Development. I carry a lot of analytical thinking and design strategy/planning from the great experiences I had back then.
  - I am a biker, a gamer, an avid reader, and an amateur watecolourist.
